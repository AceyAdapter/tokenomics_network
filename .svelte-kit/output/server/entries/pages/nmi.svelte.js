                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">The Rich Media Production course was my first experience with a development course at the New Media Institute. I developed skills in native application development in the Xcode IDE using Swift. I found the syntax of Swift to be very intuitive and fun to work with. This course sparked a passion for mobile development that I am pursuing through freelance work at UGA. I also created an iOS development course targeted at middle school coders that was inspired by this class.</p>
                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">The first app I am featuring here is my version of the card game, blackjack. I wanted to create a game in Swift, because I\u2019ve always been interested in all the game logic that goes on behind the scenes in order to make your favorite games work. This app taught me a lot about data structures in Swift and how to manage ObservableObjects. It also taught me that I am very bad at blackjack and should stay as far away from Las Vegas as possible.</p>
                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">One of my favorite applications that I\u2019ve created in this course was the \u201CMy Fridge\u201D app. This app was much more utility-based than the other projects I\u2019v created and it helped me gain a deeper understanding of many technical concepts in Swift (i.e. Push Notifications, App Icons, JSON Requests). I aimed to create a tool that could be used to keep track of the items in your fridge and remind you (via Push Notifications) when food is about to expire. I also utilized a recipe search API in order to give the user custom recommendations based on the items in their fridge. I hope to continue developing this app outside of the scope of the class and possibly put it on the App Store.</p></div></div></div>

                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">This course marked my third semester being involved at the New Media Institute. I\u2019ve had previous experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but this class helped me refine my web development skills to the point where I was able to work on a freelance project for my final project. I also got a chance to really explore the interesting (and extremely frustrating) world of Javascript, and I was surprised by what it allowed me to do.</p>
                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">One of my favorite projects was my midterm, where I built a page tracking the top 200 cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization. The list view shows each coin\u2019s: rank, name, logo, price, 24 change in price, market cap, 24 hour volume, and circulating supply. Each name can be clicked that brings you to a dynamic page that pulls deeper information for that coin from the CoinGecko API based on the name you click. It was fun learning how to use the CoinGecko API and building a single page that could be used for all 200 coins.</p>
                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">Near the end of the semester, I reached out to a cryptocurrency project on Reddit and asked if I could get involved with development. One of the team members answered back saying they needed a dashboard built tracking relevant statistics for their token. Equipped with my new web development skills, I was able to put together the full website and host it using Heroku. When I released the website, there was an influx of users which quickly started causing issues because of the way I was calling the APIs. I put together a fix by pulling the data on the dashboard from my own database and hosting a script that would update the database every 45 seconds with the current data. It\u2019s been such an awesome opportunity to put the skills I learned in this class to the test in a real world situation and at the time I posted this the website has had 500+ unique visitors.</p></div></div></div>

            <div><h1 class="${"text-5xl font-bold"}">NMIXperts</h1>
                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">Along with my Advanced New Media Production class this semester, I participated in the NMIXperts program where I held office hours two times a week and served as a resource for other NMI students to ask questions. My area of \u201CXpertise\u201D was development which tends to align with the heaviest questions, such as: \u201CCan I build an app that does X?\u201D Or more often: \u201CHow do I center this text on my website?\u201D</p>
                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">Jokes aside, this was an amazing opportunity as it allowed me to explore specific areas of development (i.e. creating passes in the Apple Wallet, interacting with HealthKit, etc.) that I probably would not have gotten a chance to try in my own projects. And I could do all this while assisting my classmates and hopefully making their experience with NMI classes better. It was a cool feeling getting attached to projects as students I helped came back with more questions.</p>
                <p class="${"py-6 pr-6"}">I was a coding teacher for 6th - 12th grade kids over the past two semesters and lots of the teaching skills I developed while working that job carried over to my experience as a student tutor. It\u2019s extremely rewarding when someone comes to me with a question and by the end of our conversation, they\u2019re able to understand their own question and be able to answer it next time.</p></div></div></div></div>`;
